IGEL SaaS / Web App Playbook Style Guide (HTML)
==============================================
Use this as a quick blueprint to spin up new, similarly branded HTML playbooks for other topics.

Core stack
- Tailwind via CDN (no build): <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
- Font: Manrope (weights 400–800) via Google Fonts.
- Icons: Prefer simple text/shape badges; avoid external icon libs unless required.
- JS: Minimal; only for mobile nav toggles or light interactions.

Brand colors
- IGEL Yellow: #ffd101 (primary accent)
- IGEL Black: #141414
- IGEL White: #ffffff
- Background: dark gradient (black/deep gray), optionally with subtle radial glows.

Logos
- Primary logo (yellow): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Broadwood11/images/main/IGEL_logo_yellow.png
- Keep logo height ~36px–40px in the header; preserve aspect ratio.

Page shell
- Body font: "Manrope", system fallbacks.
- Background: radial/linear dark gradient; keep text high-contrast (#f4f4f5/white).
- Use subtle “spark” radial highlights for atmosphere; low opacity.

Navigation (desktop)
- Left sticky rail, ~230px wide, position: sticky, top ~88px.
- Each link: pill/rounded rectangle with a small numbered bubble (yellow gradient) + label.
- Rail container: dark glassy panel with 1px soft border; shadow for lift.
- When viewport height is tight, allow the rail to scroll (max-height ~calc(100vh - 120px), thin scrollbar); on tall screens, let it breathe naturally.

Navigation (mobile)
- Keep a top "Menu" toggle that reveals a grid of pill links.
- Use compact rounded pills with light borders and hover/focus transitions.
- Cap menu height around 65vh and enable vertical scrolling so the full list is always reachable.

Header / hero strip
- Left: IGEL logo + 2-line text block (kicker and title).
- Right (desktop): hero text stack with a short tagline; keep it concise.
- Background: black/neutral gradient with slight blur; thin bottom border line.

Section headers
- Section label: <h1> in IGEL Yellow (class "igel-section-number"), sized up (~1.45rem).
- Title: <h3> in white (class "igel-section-title") with a clamp so it scales on larger displays.
- Optional hint: uppercase microcopy on the right (class "section-hint").
- Underline headers with a subtle bottom border and spacing.

Cards and blocks
- Use rounded 18–22px corners, 1px soft border, dark glass backgrounds, and hover-lift states.
- Accent blocks: light yellow radial background wash; keep text white/neutral.
- Pills: thin yellow border + uppercase tracking; sparing use.
- Stat bars: gray track with a yellow-to-orange gradient fill; short descriptive copy.

Typography
- Kicker labels: uppercase, letter-spaced, small (10–12px), yellow or neutral.
- Body text: 14–16px, neutral-200/300; avoid long walls of text—use short lists.
- List markers: use simple bullets (-) or “•”; avoid mojibake characters.

Layout rhythm
- Max content width ~1024–1180px.
- Main grid: [nav rail | content]; content stack with 32–40px vertical rhythm between sections.
- Keep consistent padding on cards (20–28px).

Background flourishes
- Optional “spark” divs: blurred radial gradients in yellow/neutral with low opacity.
- Avoid heavy patterns; keep it subtle so content stays readable.

Responsive tips
- Hide the left rail below lg; rely on the mobile menu pills.
- Clamp section titles so they scale smoothly on larger displays.
- Avoid fixed heights; let cards grow with content.

Messaging layout
- Primary messaging table should span the content width with a min-width (~780px) and horizontal scroll if needed; use generous padding on cells.
- Place quick positioning lines in their own full-width card beneath the primary message block.

Reuseable class ideas (if not using Tailwind @apply):
- .igel-card: rounded-2xl, border border-neutral-800, bg-neutral-900/80, shadow, backdrop-blur.
- .igel-pill: inline-flex, rounded-full, thin yellow border, uppercase tracking.
- .igel-section-number: bold yellow section label (h1-sized).
- .igel-section-title: bold white title (h3).
- .igel-heading-highlight: apply IGEL yellow to key hero headings.
- .section-hint: uppercase microcopy with a short gradient underline pseudo-element.
- .nav-rail: sticky vertical container; .nav-index: yellow circle badge.

Content guidance
- Lead each page with a strong “value headline” and a short supporting paragraph.
- Use 3–4 high-impact proof visuals: cheat-sheet block, ROI stat bars, or mini comparison cards.
- Keep objections, competitive points, and ROI in compact cards for fast scanning.
- End with a “Before you leave” checklist in a highlighted box.

Accessibility & polish
- Provide :focus-visible states on interactive elements (outline/offset in yellow).
- Ensure sufficient contrast (aim for WCAG AA on text).
- Keep motion subtle; respect prefers-reduced-motion by turning off transitions if implemented.
